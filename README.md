This is an experiment to see what gets in the way when I attempt to write a version Space War to run in the browser in 25 minutes over and over again. specification.yaml is the one carry-over from one attempt to the next. Changing "technologies" is encouraged. First pass: one file 'raw' JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
